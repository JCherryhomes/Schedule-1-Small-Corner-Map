### Added
- **Compass Ring**: A new directional compass surrounding the minimap shows cardinal directions (N, E, S, W) and tick marks to help with navigation
- **Off-Map Markers**: When vehicles, contracts, or properties are outside the minimap view, they now appear as icons on the compass ring to show their direction
- **Time Display Repositioned**: The in-game time display has been moved below the compass for better visibility and organization

### Improved
- Compass can be toggled on/off in the mod preferences (default: enabled)

## 2.4.0 - 2025-11-16
### Added
- Separate Mono-only and IL2CPP-only zip packages (each contains just its respective DLL in the Mods folder) to simplify choosing the appropriate runtime.
