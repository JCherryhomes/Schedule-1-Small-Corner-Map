      Copy this file to "Local.props" (without .example) and update the paths
      to match your game installation locations. Local.props is git-ignored.
      
      IMPORTANT: Include the full path to the game folder (e.g., "Schedule I" or "Schedule I - IL2CPP")
      
      Common configurations:
      - Both in same Steam library (default location):
        <MonoGamePath>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I</MonoGamePath>
        <IL2CPPGamePath>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I - IL2CPP</IL2CPPGamePath>
      
      - Both in same Steam library (custom location):
        <MonoGamePath>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Schedule I</MonoGamePath>
        <IL2CPPGamePath>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Schedule I</IL2CPPGamePath>
      
      - Different Steam libraries:
        <MonoGamePath>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I</MonoGamePath>
        <IL2CPPGamePath>E:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I</IL2CPPGamePath>
      
      - Only building one configuration (e.g., only Mono):
        <MonoGamePath>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Schedule I</MonoGamePath>
    -->
    
    <!-- Full path to Mono game installation -->
    <MonoGamePath>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I</MonoGamePath>
    
    <!-- Full path to IL2CPP game installation -->
    <IL2CPPGamePath>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I</IL2CPPGamePath>
